# Weather App with Python API Integration

## Project Overview

This project is a Python-based weather application that integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display real-time weather data for any location. The app provides essential weather information such as temperature, humidity, and general weather conditions in a user-friendly format.
Features

Fetch real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
Display key weather details including:
> Temperature (Celsius/Fahrenheit)
> Humidity level
> Weather conditions (Clear, Cloudy, Rainy, etc.)
Simple and user-friendly interface for inputting location and viewing weather updates.

### Technologies Used

> Python: Core programming language.
> OpenWeatherMap API: Used to fetch weather data.
> JSON Parsing: To extract and display specific data from API responses.

### Requirements

> Python 3.x
> OpenWeatherMap API key (sign up at OpenWeatherMap to get an API key)

### How to Use

> Clone the repository:

> bash

`git clone <repository-url>`

> Install necessary dependencies:

> bash

`pip install requests`

Get your OpenWeatherMap API key.
Open the weather_app.py file and insert your API key:

python

api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

Run the script:

bash

python weather_app.py

Input the desired city to get the current weather conditions.
